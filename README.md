# BadCat
BadCat contains exploits that will help you remove icloud, remove the screen password, or give you full access to control your smartphone and many other exploits and utilities. BadCat requires checkra1n to be installed and if you are using all exploits except bypassing icloud you will need to install a Cydia tweak called "OpenSSH" (In some cases it works without this tweak). BadCat is currently only available for macOS. A release for Windows and Linux will be released soon.
